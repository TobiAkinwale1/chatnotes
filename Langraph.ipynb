    "LangGraph is an advanced concept within the LangChain framework designed to handle agent orchestration. Agent orchestration involves managing and coordinating multiple agents (autonomous units) that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with each other or external systems to achieve complex objectives. LangGraph helps structure and control these interactions efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph in Agent Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition and Purpose**:\n",
    "   - **LangGraph**: A system that organizes the flow and interaction of various agents to perform complex tasks in a coordinated manner. It ensures that agents can work together seamlessly, sharing information and decision-making processes.\n",
    "   - **Agent Orchestration**: The management and coordination of multiple agents to perform tasks efficiently, ensuring they work together towards a common goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Components of LangGraph**:\n",
    "   - **Nodes**: Represent individual agents or tasks within the graph.\n",
    "   - **Edges**: Define the relationships and flow of information between nodes.\n",
    "   - **Control Logic**: Governs how and when agents are activated, how they interact, and how data flows through the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functionality**:\n",
    "   - **Task Delegation**: LangGraph can delegate specific tasks to different agents based on their capabilities and the requirements of the task.\n",
    "   - **Data Flow Management**: It controls how data is passed between agents, ensuring that each agent has the necessary information to perform its task.\n",
    "   - **Decision Making**: Agents within the LangGraph can make decisions based on the data they receive and the outcomes of previous tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits**:\n",
    "   - **Modularity**: LangGraph allows for a modular approach to building complex systems, where each agent can be developed and tested independently.\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: By managing interactions and data flow, LangGraph enables the system to scale efficiently, handling more agents and tasks as needed.\n",
    "   - **Flexibility**: It provides a flexible framework where agents can be added, removed, or modified without disrupting the overall system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where LangGraph is used to build a customer support system with multiple specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents**:\n",
    "   - **Customer Query Agent**: Handles initial customer queries.\n",
    "   - **FAQ Agent**: Provides answers to frequently asked questions.\n",
    "   - **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Analyzes the sentiment of customer messages.\n",
    "   - **Escalation Agent**: Escalates complex issues to human support staff.\n",
    "   - **Follow-up Agent**: Ensures customer issues are resolved and gathers feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LangGraph Setup**:\n",
    "   - **Nodes**: Each agent (Customer Query Agent, FAQ Agent, Sentiment Analysis Agent, Escalation Agent, Follow-up Agent) is represented as a node.\n",
    "   - **Edges**: Define the flow of tasks. For example, the Customer Query Agent might pass the query to the FAQ Agent. If the FAQ Agent can't resolve the issue, it passes the task to the Escalation Agent.\n",
    "   - **Control Logic**: Determines how agents interact. For instance, if the Sentiment Analysis Agent detects a negative sentiment, it might trigger an immediate escalation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flow of Interaction**:\n",
    "   - A customer submits a query.\n",
    "   - The Customer Query Agent processes the query and determines it is a frequently asked question.\n",
    "   - The FAQ Agent provides an answer. If the answer is satisfactory, the interaction ends.\n",
    "   - If the FAQ Agent cannot resolve the issue, the query is passed to the Escalation Agent.\n",
    "   - The Sentiment Analysis Agent continually monitors the conversation to detect any frustration or dissatisfaction.\n",
    "   - The Follow-up Agent ensures the issue was resolved and collects customer feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you might define and use LangGraph for agent orchestration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain import LangGraph, Node, Edge\n",
    "from langchain.agents import Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define your agents\n",
    "class CustomerQueryAgent(Agent):\n",
    "    def handle_query(self, query):\n",
    "        # Process the query\n",
    "        return \"FAQ\"  # For simplicity, assume all queries are FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "class FAQAgent(Agent):\n",
    "    def provide_answer(self, query):\n",
    "        return \"Here is the answer to your question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class EscalationAgent(Agent):\n",
    "    def escalate_issue(self, query):\n",
    "        return \"Escalating your issue to human support.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize agents\n",
    "customer_query_agent = CustomerQueryAgent()\n",
    "faq_agent = FAQAgent()\n",
    "escalation_agent = EscalationAgent()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define nodes for each agent\n",
    "customer_query_node = Node(agent=customer_query_agent, task=\"handle_query\")\n",
    "faq_node = Node(agent=faq_agent, task=\"provide_answer\")\n",
    "escalation_node = Node(agent=escalation_agent, task=\"escalate_issue\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define edges to determine the flow\n",
    "edges = [\n",
    "    Edge(source=customer_query_node, target=faq_node, condition=lambda x: x == \"FAQ\"),\n",
    "    Edge(source=faq_node, target=escalation_node, condition=lambda x: x == \"Escalate\")\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create LangGraph\n",
    "lang_graph = LangGraph(nodes=[customer_query_node, faq_node, escalation_node], edges=edges)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example interaction\n",
    "query = \"How do I reset my password?\"\n",
    "result = lang_graph.execute(start_node=customer_query_node, input_data=query)\n",
    "print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents**: Defined as classes inheriting from a base `Agent` class. Each agent has a method to handle specific tasks.\n",
    "2. **Nodes**: Each agent is represented as a `Node` in the LangGraph.\n",
    "3. **Edges**: Define the flow of tasks between nodes based on conditions.\n",
    "4. **LangGraph**: Combines nodes and edges to manage the flow of tasks.\n",
    "5. **Execution**: The graph executes starting from the `CustomerQueryAgent`, passing data through nodes based on defined edges and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the basic concept of LangGraph in agent orchestration, showing how it can manage interactions and tasks in a structured and efficient manner."
